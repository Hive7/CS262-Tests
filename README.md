# CS262 Testing Script

## Setup Linux

Make sure you have swipl installed then just create the venv:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that your .pl file is in the directory or pass it as an argument to the script

Then run the autogenerated tests with:

`python test.py`

Or a specific test file in the `tests` folder using the `--tests` options. **_ PLEASE NOTE THAT TESTS HAVE TO BE IN THIS FOLDER _**

Arguments and what they do can be found with `--help`

## Creating own tests

Populate a CSV in the tests folder with separators of "|"

# Coursework Solutions

I cannot provide the correct answers to the coursework problems as its part of the coursework to
identify them. However, if you fill your solutions into the `base.csv` file you can test them. They
can be found by subbing into a truth table generator such as
[here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/). Where its YES iff the entire
table is yes.
